## The Role of Opportunity Solution Trees (OSTs)

An **Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)** is a visual framework that helps you connect identified opportunities to potential solutions and experiments. By visualizing how opportunities lead to solutions, you can better understand which opportunities are worth prioritizing and how to validate them through tests and experiments.

- **Opportunity Mapping** ‚Üí Identify and group opportunities.

## Real-World Example: How Airbnb Approaches Opportunity Mapping and Prioritization

Airbnb‚Äôs product team has always focused on **trust and safety** as a core feature. Early on, through **customer interviews** and **user feedback**, Airbnb identified concerns around the **verification process** for both hosts and guests. They mapped these pain points into opportunities for improvement, such as streamlining the **profile verification** process and building **trust** in the platform.

Rather than relying on rigid frameworks, Airbnb uses a more **iterative approach**, constantly revisiting and adjusting their priorities based on **ongoing feedback** and **user testing**. They prioritize issues that directly affect **customer trust**, using **rapid prototyping** and **A/B testing** to validate solutions in real-time.

This approach allowed Airbnb to **increase user confidence**, leading to higher **conversion rates** and **better customer satisfaction**.
