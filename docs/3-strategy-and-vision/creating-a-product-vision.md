# Creating a Product Vision 🌟

A **product vision** is the North Star that guides your team and aligns stakeholders around a shared understanding of what the product aims to achieve. It provides clarity, focus, and motivation, ensuring that every decision supports a bigger picture. In this section, we’ll explore how to craft a compelling product vision that is **customer-centric**, adaptable, and aligned with business goals.

## Why a Product Vision Matters

A strong product vision:
- **Aligns Teams**: Provides a unified direction for product, design, and engineering teams.
- **Inspires Action**: Motivates teams by showing how their work contributes to a greater goal.
- **Drives Decisions**: Acts as a filter for prioritizing features and making trade-offs.
- **Adapts Over Time**: Evolves based on insights gathered through continuous discovery.

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: A product vision is not set in stone. It should evolve based on validated learnings from discovery efforts.

## Steps to Create a Compelling Product Vision

### 1. **Start with Your Company Mission**
Your product vision should align with your company’s mission and values. For example:
- **Company Mission**: "Empowering small businesses to grow."
- **Product Vision**: "To create tools that help small businesses manage their finances with ease and confidence."

---

### 2. **Understand Customer Needs**
Use insights from user research and discovery activities to define customer needs and pain points. Tools like the **Opportunity Solution Tree** (Teresa Torres) can help map out opportunities and align them with your vision.

---

### 3. **Define the Outcome**
A product vision should focus on the **outcome**, not just the output. For example:
- Instead of: "Build a financial dashboard."
- Focus on: "Help small business owners make informed financial decisions."

---

### 4. **Make It Clear and Concise**
A product vision should be easy to understand and communicate. Aim for one or two sentences that capture the essence of your product's purpose.

**Example**:  
*"Empowering teams to collaborate effectively, no matter where they are."*

> 💡 **Don’t overcomplicate it!**  
*“Your product vision shouldn’t sound like a horoscope—vague enough to apply to anything but guiding nothing. For example: ‘We aim to revolutionize the digital landscape.’ Cool, but what does that mean?”* 😅

## Real-World Example: Netflix

Netflix’s product vision has evolved with the company’s mission to "entertain the world." By continuously adapting their vision to user needs and market trends, Netflix shifted from DVD rentals to streaming, and later into original content, always focusing on creating value for users.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Broad**: A vision that tries to cover everything ends up being meaningless.  
2. **Too Rigid**: A vision that doesn’t adapt to customer insights or market changes can quickly become irrelevant.  
3. **Too Vague**: A vision that lacks clarity won’t inspire or guide your team.

## Conclusion

A compelling product vision is the cornerstone of product success. It aligns teams, drives decisions, and ensures that your efforts are focused on delivering value to your users. Remember, your vision is a living document—refine it continuously based on discovery insights.
