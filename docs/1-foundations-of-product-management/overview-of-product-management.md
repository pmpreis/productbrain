# Overview of Product Management ðŸ“‹

Product management is the strategic process of guiding a product from conception through its lifecycle, ensuring that it meets user needs and aligns with business goals. Product managers (PMs) play a key role in defining what gets built, why it matters, and how it drives value for users and the organization.

## The Product Management Process

Product management is a continuous journey that involves understanding problems, exploring potential solutions, and delivering value. The **Double Diamond Framework** provides a structured approach to this process, dividing it into stages of **problem discovery** and **solution development**.

In this framework, the product management process is divided into four key stages:

1. **Discover**: Engage in open-ended conversations with core personas to gather unfiltered insights, avoiding preconceived notions.
2. **Define**: Analyze collected information to identify and prioritize key problem areas, ensuring alignment with user needs and business objectives.
3. **Develop**: Generate a range of potential solutions, encouraging creative collaboration among team members.
4. **Deliver**: Test and refine the chosen solution, implementing it effectively to meet user needs and achieve desired outcomes.

By using this framework, product managers can approach development in a way that encourages continuous learning and improvement, with a focus on refining and validating ideas at each step.
