# Aligning Prioritization with Vision and Bets 🎯

Effective prioritization is more than scoring features or initiatives—it’s about ensuring that what you choose to work on aligns with your product’s vision and strategic bets. This alignment keeps teams focused on high-impact projects that drive the product towards its long-term goals.

---

## Why Alignment Matters

1. **Purposeful Progress**: Aligning prioritization with the vision and bets helps ensure that each initiative moves the product closer to its overarching goals.
2. **Resource Optimization**: Focuses resources on initiatives that provide the highest strategic value.
3. **Stakeholder Confidence**: Demonstrates to stakeholders that every effort is connected to broader objectives, building trust in the prioritization process.

> 🔍 *Insight*: When prioritization aligns with vision and bets, the roadmap becomes a story of intentional growth rather than a list of isolated features.

## Steps for Aligning Prioritization

### 1. Start with the Vision

Before scoring or ranking items, revisit the product vision. Ask how each initiative contributes to this vision and whether it supports the product’s purpose.

### 2. Connect to Strategic Bets

Determine which initiatives align with active bets. This helps focus on opportunities that have already been validated as high-impact areas for growth or differentiation.

### 3. Evaluate Impact on Key Goals

Consider the potential impact of each initiative on key goals or metrics (e.g., user engagement, retention, revenue). Higher-impact initiatives that align with vision and bets should take priority.

> 🎯 *Example*: If a bet is focused on improving user retention, prioritize features that enhance user experience and engagement over unrelated features.

---

## Tools for Maintaining Alignment

- **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**: Use OKRs to set goals that link initiatives to broader objectives.
- **Roadmap Reviews**: Regularly review the roadmap with stakeholders to ensure continued alignment with vision and bets.

## Conclusion

Aligning prioritization with vision and bets helps teams make decisions that are not only efficient but also strategic, driving meaningful progress toward long-term success.
