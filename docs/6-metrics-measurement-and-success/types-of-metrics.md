# Types of Metrics 📊

Metrics come in various shapes and sizes, each providing a unique lens to evaluate the performance of your product. Understanding the types of metrics can help you measure success more effectively and focus on the ones that truly matter.

## Categories of Metrics

1. **Usage Metrics**  
   - Track how users interact with your product.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Daily Active Users (DAU)  
     - Monthly Active Users (MAU)  
     - Session Length  

2. **Engagement Metrics**  
   - Measure how actively users engage with your product.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Retention Rate  
     - Frequency of Use  

3. **Acquisition Metrics**  
   - Reflect how effectively you’re acquiring new users.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Conversion Rate  
     - Cost per Acquisition (CPA)  
     - Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL)  

4. **Retention Metrics**  
   - Show how well your product retains its users over time.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - **Cohort Retention**: Analyze how groups of users behave over time after onboarding.  
     - **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Measures customer satisfaction and likelihood to recommend.  
     - **Churn Rate**: The percentage of users who stop using the product over a specific period. A high churn rate indicates retention challenges and requires investigation.  

5. **Financial Metrics**  
   - Evaluate the financial performance of your product.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)  
     - Revenue Growth Rate  
     - Average Revenue per User (ARPU)

## Choosing the Right Metrics

Selecting the right metrics depends on the stage of your product and your business goals.  
- **Early-Stage Products**: Focus on acquisition and engagement.  
- **Growth-Stage Products**: Prioritize retention and revenue.  
- **Mature Products**: Track profitability and user satisfaction.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Overloading with Metrics**: Tracking too many metrics can dilute focus. Stick to a few meaningful ones.  
- **Vanity Metrics**: Avoid metrics that look good but don’t drive actionable insights (e.g., app downloads without understanding usage).  
- **Isolated Metrics**: Always look at metrics in context. A spike in DAU might not be positive if churn also increases.

> **Joke**: “If your churn rate is higher than your engagement rate, congratulations—you’ve created a revolving door app.” 🚪
