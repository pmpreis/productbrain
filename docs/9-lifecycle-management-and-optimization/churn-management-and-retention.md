# Churn Management and Retention 🔄

Managing churn and improving user retention are essential for long-term product success. Retaining existing users is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, and reducing churn helps maintain a stable, engaged user base. By focusing on user satisfaction and addressing reasons for disengagement, product teams can foster loyalty and reduce attrition.
