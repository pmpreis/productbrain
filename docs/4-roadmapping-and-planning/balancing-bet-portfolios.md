# Balancing Bet Portfolios ⚖️

Balancing a portfolio of bets is about distributing resources and focus across short-term wins and long-term growth initiatives. A well-balanced portfolio ensures that product development efforts drive both immediate impact and sustainable progress.

## Why Balancing is Important

1. **Risk Management**: A balanced portfolio spreads risk across different types of bets, reducing dependency on any single initiative.
2. **Sustainable Growth**: Combining short-term and long-term bets allows teams to meet immediate needs while preparing for future growth.
3. **Alignment with Vision**: Ensures that all bets, whether short-term or long-term, are aligned with the product vision.

> ⚖️ *Insight*: A portfolio that’s too heavily focused on short-term gains might neglect the innovations needed for future success, while a long-term focus could miss immediate opportunities.
