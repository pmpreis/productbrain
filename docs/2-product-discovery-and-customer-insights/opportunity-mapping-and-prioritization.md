# Opportunity Mapping and Prioritization 🗺️

Opportunity mapping and prioritization help teams focus on the most valuable opportunities. By systematically evaluating and prioritizing these opportunities, product managers can ensure that resources are allocated effectively to meet both user and business needs.

## What is Opportunity Mapping?

Opportunity mapping is the process of identifying and visualizing opportunities that align with product and business goals. It provides a clear view of where the product can deliver the most value.

> 🔍 *Pro Tip*: Use opportunity maps to visualize relationships between user pain points, goals, and potential solutions.

## Prioritization Techniques

Once opportunities are mapped, it’s time to prioritize them. Here are some effective techniques:

1. **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**: Rate opportunities based on their potential impact and the effort required to execute.
2. **RICE**: Use Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort to score and prioritize opportunities.
3. **MoSCoW**: Classify opportunities as Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, and Won’t-Have.

> 💡 *Quick Insight*: Prioritization isn’t a one-time task; revisit it regularly as new insights emerge.

## Conclusion

Opportunity mapping and prioritization provide structure to decision-making, helping product managers focus on what matters most.
