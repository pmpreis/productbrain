# About Me 👋

Hi there! I’m **Pedro Reis**, a digital product manager with experience working in startups, scale-ups, enterprise companies, and consulting firms. Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work across industries like telecom, banking, energy, real estate, contact centres, and even luxury fashion. These diverse experiences have shaped my approach to product management: **getting the maximum customer value with the minimum output possible**.

I hold a degree in Software Engineering and an Executive MBA, and I’m passionate about exploring new tools and gadgets to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. I’m also the community manager at **The Impostor PM Lisbon**, where I help product managers share experiences, frustrations, and wins.  

I created **Product Brain**, this knowledge base, because while the books I referenced are excellent, they can also be repetitive. My goal was to merge insights from different sources, cut unnecessary fluff, and make product management knowledge super simple to understand. If you want to dive deeper into any topic, you can always explore more, but here, you’ll find a clear and concise starting point.  

When I’m not working, you’ll find me gaming 🎮, experimenting with dessert recipes 🍰, or spending time with my family.
