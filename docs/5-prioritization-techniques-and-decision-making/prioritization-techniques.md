# Prioritization Techniques ⚖️

There are several frameworks that product managers use to prioritize features, improvements, and initiatives. Each technique has its own strengths, allowing teams to evaluate ideas based on impact, effort, user value, and alignment with strategic goals. Here’s a look at some of the most popular prioritization techniques.

## 1. ICE Scoring

**ICE** stands for **Impact**, **Confidence**, and **Ease**. Each initiative is scored on these criteria, and the total score helps determine the order of priorities.

- **Impact**: The potential positive effect on users or the business.
- **Confidence**: The certainty that the initiative will succeed.
- **Ease**: The level of effort required to execute.

> 📊 *Formula*: ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease

## 2. RICE Scoring

**RICE** is a more comprehensive scoring model, considering **Reach**, **Impact**, **Confidence**, and **Effort**.

- **Reach**: How many users will the initiative affect?
- **Impact**: How significant is the effect for each user?
- **Confidence**: How sure are you of your estimates?
- **Effort**: How much time, talent, or money is required?

> 📈 *Formula*: RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
