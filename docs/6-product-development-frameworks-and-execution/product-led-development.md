# Product-Led Development ðŸš€

Product-Led Development is an approach where the product itself drives customer acquisition, engagement, and growth. In this model, the product is designed to offer immediate value, converting users into customers through a seamless and compelling experience.

## Key Principles of Product-Led Development

1. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on creating an intuitive, value-driven product that meets user needs from the start.
2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Leverage user data and analytics to make continuous improvements and personalize the experience.
