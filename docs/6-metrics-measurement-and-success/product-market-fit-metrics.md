# Product-Market Fit Metrics 💡

Achieving product-market fit is one of the most critical milestones for any product team. It signals that your product is resonating with its target audience and solving meaningful problems. Measuring product-market fit requires tracking metrics that reflect both user satisfaction and market demand.

## Key Indicators of Product-Market Fit

1. **Retention Metrics**  
   - High retention rates suggest that users find consistent value in your product.  
   - **Example**: Cohort retention curves that flatten over time indicate long-term stickiness.

2. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**  
   - Measures how likely users are to recommend your product to others.  
   - A score of **70+** is often considered excellent for consumer products.

3. **Usage Growth**  
   - Rapid increases in usage metrics like Monthly Active Users (MAU) can indicate demand.  
   - Beware of spikes driven by promotions or one-time events.

4. **Customer Feedback**  
   - Surveys like the **Sean Ellis Test**: Ask users, “How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?”
     - **Benchmark**: If 40% or more respond with “very disappointed,” you’re likely on the path to product-market fit.

5. **Churn Rate**  
   - A low churn rate signals that customers find sustained value in your product.  
   - **Pro Tip**: Investigate why customers leave to uncover areas for improvement.

6. **Revenue and Unit Economics**  
   - Metrics like CLTV and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) help ensure your product is not only desirable but also viable.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Relying on a Single Metric**: Product-market fit is multi-dimensional. Don’t put all your focus on one indicator.  
- **Ignoring Qualitative Feedback**: Metrics provide the “what,” but qualitative data explains the “why.”  
- **Chasing Growth Too Early**: Achieving product-market fit should come before aggressive scaling.
