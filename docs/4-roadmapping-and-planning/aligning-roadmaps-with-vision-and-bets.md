# Aligning Roadmaps with Vision and Bets 🎯

An effective roadmap doesn’t just list features or tasks; it aligns with the product’s vision and strategic bets. By ensuring that each roadmap item supports the broader vision, you maintain consistency and focus across the team, making every initiative part of a coherent strategy.

---

## Why Alignment Matters

1. **Consistency**: Keeps all teams aligned with the product's vision, ensuring that day-to-day work supports long-term goals.
2. **Prioritization**: Helps prioritize initiatives that drive the most impact and value.
3. **Clear Communication**: Makes it easier to communicate the roadmap’s purpose and strategic importance to stakeholders.

> 🔍 *Insight*: Roadmaps that lack alignment with vision and bets often result in feature overload without clear direction or purpose.

## Steps for Aligning Roadmaps

### 1. Start with the Vision

Begin each roadmap by reaffirming the product vision. Ensure that every item on the roadmap is connected back to this overarching goal.

### 2. Link to Strategic Bets

Identify how each feature or initiative supports specific bets. This might mean prioritizing projects that align with high-impact bets over those with lower strategic value.

### 3. Review and Adjust Regularly

Regularly revisit your roadmap to ensure alignment as new insights and shifts in priorities emerge. This flexibility ensures your roadmap remains relevant and impactful.

> 🎯 *Example*: If a bet focuses on increasing user retention, roadmap items like "Improve onboarding experience" or "Introduce loyalty rewards" would align well with this goal.

---

## Tools for Alignment

- **Vision Statements**: Include a brief vision reminder at the top of your roadmap.
- **Bets Mapping**: Clearly label which bets each roadmap item supports to maintain alignment.

## Conclusion

Aligning your roadmap with vision and strategic bets ensures that every initiative has a purpose, contributing to a cohesive product strategy.
