## 1. Setting Vision and Strategy 🌟

A product manager’s first big task is to define a clear, compelling vision that aligns with the company’s broader goals. Think of this as the product’s North Star!

- **Setting the Vision**: The vision provides direction for the product, keeping everyone aligned on what success looks like.
