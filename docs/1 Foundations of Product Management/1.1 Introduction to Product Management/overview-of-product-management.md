# Overview of Product Management 😃

## Definition and Scope

Product management is the organizational function responsible for guiding the development, marketing, and continuous improvement of a product throughout its lifecycle. Product managers (PMs) are at the intersection of business, technology, and user experience, ensuring that a product meets customer needs and achieves business objectives. 

They’re basically the superheroes of the product world! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️

## History and Evolution 📜

The concept of product management has evolved significantly over time. Initially focused on tangible products, the role has expanded to encompass digital products and services. Key milestones in its evolution include:

| Period      | Milestone                                                                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Early 1900s | Procter & Gamble introduced the brand management concept, laying the groundwork for modern product management. |
| 1980s       | The rise of software development highlighted the need for dedicated product managers to bridge the gap between technical teams and customer needs. |
| 2000s       | Agile methodologies and Lean Startup principles reshaped product management, emphasizing continuous delivery and validated learning. |

And just like that, product managers went from being unsung heroes to rock stars of the tech world! 🎸
